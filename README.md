# install-popup
can be used while downloading large packages: you won`t waste time staring at terminal while package is downloading. 

there are 2 options:
- process file with bunch of packages
- process string from user input


what to be done (under consideration):

- make script run as daemon: all installing packages are under condition. if installation takes more than 15s, result of installation will be showed in pop-up window
